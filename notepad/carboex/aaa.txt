Differnce in web2 and web3

--> web2
Web2 refers to the current generation of the internet, where most applications and services are centralized and controlled by a single entity. Web2 version of app like VidWeave  allows users to record videos directly on their devices and then upload them to the servers of the app for storage and sharing.

--> web 3
Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, which is built on decentralized technologies like blockchain. VidWeave is created with blockchain technologies, in this the video recording process can be similar, but instead of uploading the video to a centralized server of app, it would be uploaded to a decentralized storage network like LightHouse or IPFS.

-------------------------
Advantages over an app created with web2

1. Decentralization: Web3 apps built on lighthouse and other decentralized technologies offer a more decentralized infrastructure compared to Web2 apps. One doesn't have to rely on single server.

2. Data ownership and control: users have more control and ownership over their data, including the videos they record.

3. Improved security: Decentralized storage networks, such as lighthouse, can provide enhanced security for video content. 

4.Transparency and auditability: Since the data stored on lighthouse is immutable and timestamped using blockchain technology, it becomes easier to verify the authenticity and integrity of the videos.
